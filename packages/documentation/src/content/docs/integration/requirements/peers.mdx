title: Peering integration guide
---

import { CodeBlock, LinkOut } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

To join the Interledger network and be able to send and receive payments, you must add one or more peer(s) to your Rafiki instance. Peering establishes the connections needed for your Rafiki instance to interact with another account servicing entity (ASE). The purpose of this guide is to help you set up and manage peers.

While this guide focuses on the conceptual and technical steps of adding and managing peers via the Backend Admin API, the Rafiki Admin application offers the same functionality in a user-friendly interface.

Refer to the [Rafiki Admin user guide](/admin/admin-user-guide#peers) for detailed instructions and examples of creating and managing peers through the application.

:::tip
Whether you are using the Backend Admin API or the Rafiki Admin application, the underlying configurations and requirements remain the same. Choose the interface that best suits your individual workflow.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before adding a peer, you and the account servicing entity you intend to peer with must both:

- Run an implementation of an [Interledger connector](/integration/deployment/services/backend-service#interledger-connector) (ideally Rafiki).
- Agree on an [asset](/overview/concepts/accounting#assets) for the peering relationship. You can set up multiple peering relationships with the same peer based on different assets. At least one asset shared by you and your peer must be added to your Rafiki instance prior to setting up the peering relationship. For more information, refer to [Assets](/integration/requirements/assets/).
- Agree on a `maxPacketAmount` value, which specifies how many packets a payment is split into.
- Communicate your respective static <LinkOut href="https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/ilp-addresses/">Interledger (ILP) addresses</LinkOut>.
- Communicate a connection endpoint for the other peer to send packets to.
- Exchange `auth` tokens for the connection endpoint.
- Agree on a settlement mechanism (a means of paying one another for the successful forwarding and delivery of packets), which is outside the scope of Interledger and Rafiki.

Optionally, you may also deposit an initial liquidity for your peer.

:::note
Peering is not required unless you want to participate in transactions with another ASE running Rafiki. For foundational peering concepts, refer to [Peers](/overview/concepts/interledger/#peers).

## Setting up peering in Rafiki

The basic workflow of setting up a peering relationship starts with adding the agreed upon asset, then adding a peer, and then creating a wallet address from where you can send and receive payments. 

### Add an asset

As mentioned in the prerequisites, an asset must be added to your Rafiki instance before creating a peering relationship. To learn how to add an asset, refer to [Assets](/integration/requirements/assets/).

### Add a peer

After adding an asset, add a peer using the `createPeer` GraphQL mutation.

#### `createPeer`

<CodeBlock title="Example createPeer Mutation">

```graphql
mutation CreatePeer($input: CreatePeerInput!) {
  createPeer(input: $input) {
    code
    success
    message
    peer {
      id
      asset {
        code
        scale
      }
      staticIlpAddress
      name
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlock>

##### Example

```json
{
  "input": {
	"staticIlpAddress": "g.othergreatwallet",
	"name": "The Other Great Wallet"
	"http": {
  		"incoming": {"authTokens": ["mytoken"]},
  		"outgoing": {"endpoint": "ilp.othergreatwallet.com", "authToken": "theirtoken"}
	  },
	"assetId": "INSERT_ASSET_ID",
	"initialLiquidity": <optionally, an intial amount of liquity to provision. Liquidity can also be deposited via the `DepositPeerLiquidity`>
  }
}
```

### Create wallet addresses

After adding a peer, we need to create a wallet address. This wallet address is where payments are sent from and received. To learn how to create a new wallet address, refer to [Assets](/integration/requirements/wallet-addresses/).

## Managing peers

Once a peer has been added to your Rafiki instance, ongoing peer management ensures that your peering integration remains functional. This includes editing configurations to reflect changes in your peer's technical details or resolving setup errors. It also includes deleting a peer that was created in error, as long as no payments have been exchanged. Active peer management helps maintain seamless payment flows and keeps your Rafiki instance up to date with operational changes.

### Edit a peer

Editing a peer allows you to adjust peering configurations or address any changes communicated by the peer. Some examples include updating new endpoints or tokens, technical settings like the maximum packet amount, or peer liquidity thresholds.

In this example we are going to update the peer we just created. Rather than change any of the peering details, we can add some optional details that we didn't include when we created the peer. We will define the `maxPacketAmount` and the `liquidityThreshold`.

#### `updatePeer`

<CodeBlock title="Example updatePeer Mutation">

```graphql
mutation UpdatePeer($input: UpdatePeerInput!) {
  updatePeer(input: $input) {
    peer {
      id
      name
      http {
        outgoing {
          authToken
          endpoint
        }
      }
      maxPacketAmount
      liquidityThreshold
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlock>

##### Example

The input object for the update operation only requires that the `id` is present. All other variables are optional. For this example we will include the required `id` variable, as well as the optional variables of the fields we wish to update. In this case, `maxPacketAmount` and `liquidityThreshold`.

<CodeBlock title='Example JSON request'>

```json
{
  "input": {
    "id": "480ef339-7842-4501-a905-923fc1339cef",
    "maxPacketAmount": 1000,
    "liquidityThreshold": 100
    }
}
```

        "liquidityThreshold": 100
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Delete a peer

Deleting a peer is an action that removes a peer from your Rafiki instance. There are specific rules and considerations to keep in mind before initating this irreversible operation.

A peer can only be deleted if no payments have been made to or received from that peer. This ensures that historical payment records are preserved. If you attempt to delete a peer with payment history, the backend will throw an error, preventing the deletion.

Deleting a peer is useful in situations where there were configuration errors when the peer was first created like an incorrect auth token or ILP address. 

:::danger
Deleting a peer is permanent and cannot be reversed. If you delete a peer in error, you must create another new peer.
