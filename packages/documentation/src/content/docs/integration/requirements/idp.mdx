An identity provider (IdP) is a system or service that stores and manages user identity information, authentication, and consent. Examples of IdPs include OpenID Connect and Okta.

Integration with an IdP is required if you plan to support outgoing payments via <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev">Open Payments</LinkOut>. Open Payments requires outgoing payment _grant_ requests, which precede outgoing payment requests, be interactive. In an interactive grant request, explicit interaction by an individual (e.g., an account holder) is required to approve the grant. An example of an interaction is an end-user tapping _Approve_ in an app to authorize a payment.

Your IdP will:

- Authenticate requests from clients, such as mobile apps, to create quotes and payments on Rafiki's backend
- Facilitate interactions with the client's end-user to gather consent

:::note
We provide Ory Kratos, a cloud-based user management system, for the identity and user management of your [Rafiki Admin](/admin/admin-user-guide) users. Kratos is for internal use only and **cannot** be used as your client-facing IdP.

### Interactions and consent

Before an outgoing payment is created via Open Payments, an outgoing payment grant must be issued.

Outgoing payment grant requests must be interactive. This means the request requires explicit interaction, often from the account holder, to gather consent (permission) to create the outgoing payment. The interaction is facilitated by your IdP. Your IdP:

<Steps>
  1. Provides an interface to gather consent (for example, a consent screen) 2.
  Sends the interaction choice (accept/deny) to your authorization server 3.
  Sends a request to your authorization server to finish the interaction 4.
  Redirects the user after the interaction is complete
</Steps>

### Authorization server

The purpose of an Open Payments authorization server is to grant permission to clients to access the Open Payments APIs. These APIs are used to create incoming payments, quotes, and outgoing payments against an account holder's account.

Rafiki's [auth service](/integration/services/auth-service) provides you with a reference implementation of an Open Payments authorization server. The server extends an [API](#interaction-endpoints) for your IdP to use to begin and finish an interaction, collect authorization, get information about a particular grant, and communicate that a user has authorized a grant. You can use the service as an alternative to developing your own in-house service.

## Environment variables

The following `backend` variables must be configured on your authorization server.

## Manage grants

Your Open Payments authorization server extends an API for your IdP server to use after a pending grant request is created.

Each interaction with an endpoint is identified by an `id` and a `nonce`. Both are provided as query parameters when your authorization server redirects to your IdP server.

The endpoints are appended to the `IDENTITY_SERVER_URL` you defined when configuring your [environment variables](#environment-variables). For example: `https://idp.wallet.example.com/interact/{id}/{nonce}`

### Interaction endpoints

The endpoints are called in the sequence listed below.

<div class="overflow-table">

| Method                                               | Endpoint                        | Purpose                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Badge text="GET" variant="note" size="medium"/>     | `/interact/{id}/{nonce}`        | [Start user interaction session](#start-user-interaction-session) |
| <Badge text="GET" variant="note" size="medium"/>     | `/grant/{id}/{nonce}`           | [Look up grant information](#look-up-grant-information)           |
| <Badge text="POST" variant="success" size="medium"/> | `/grant/{id}/{nonce}/{choice}`  | [Accept or reject grant](#accept-or-reject-grant)                 |
| <Badge text="GET" variant="note" size="medium"/>     | `/interact/{id}/{nonce}/finish` | [Finish user interaction](#finish-interaction)<br />              |
| <Badge text="POST" variant="success" size="medium"/> | `/interact/{id}/{nonce}`        | [Continue grant](#continue-grant)                                 |

</div>

We also provide an <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/packages/auth/src/openapi/specs/id-provider.yaml">OpenAPI specification</LinkOut> that describes the endpoints.

#### Start user interaction session

Called by the client to establish an interactive session with your authorization server. Also redirects the client's browser session to your IdP consent screen.

#### Look up grant information

Called by your IdP server, and secured with an [`x-idp-secret`](#x-idp-secret-header) header, to get the list of access rights the client requested from your authorization server.

The access rights are presented to the client's end-user on the consent screen. The authorization server's response is served on your defined [`INTERACTION_PORT`](#environment-variables).

#### Accept or reject grant

Called by your IdP server, and secured with an [`x-idp-secret`](#x-idp-secret-header) header, to communicate the choice made by the end-user on the consent screen (accept/deny) to your authorization server.

Your IdP server then redirects to the `finish` endpoint. The response is served on your defined [`INTERACTION_PORT`](#environment-variables)

#### Finish interaction

Called by your IdP server to end the interaction and redirect the end-user's browser session to the URI of the <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request/">grant initialization request</LinkOut>.

The `result` query parameter will indicate the success or failure of the grant authorization. When successful, the SHA-256 hash of the interaction is sent in the response along with an `interact_ref` that identifies the interaction on your authorization server and the URI of the grant initialization request.

The following are examples of the possible response types.

<div class="overflow-table wider-column">

| Response | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Example                                                                                                                          |

</div>

#### Continue grant

Called by the client to request a grant from your authorization server if the interaction was successful (accepted). Your authorization server responds with an <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/apis/auth-server/operations/post-continue/">access token</LinkOut>.

### x-idp-secret header

The purpose of the `x-idp-secret` header is to secure communications between your IdP and authorization servers.

The header is used for requests to the following endpoints and its value should be a shared secret known to both entities.

- `GET /grant/:id/:nonce`
- `POST /grant/:id/:nonce/accept`
- `POST /grant/:id/:nonce/reject`

When your IdP server sends requests to your authorization server, your IdP must provide the secret via this header.

To set up the header, set the [`IDENTITY_SERVER_SECRET`](#environment-variables) on your authorization server environment to a value that is also used to configure your IdP server's requests to your authorization server.

The following diagram provides a high-level view of the flow from when a pending grant request is created through to the authorization server returning an access token to continue a successful (accepted) interaction.

The diagram is for illustrative purposes and is not an exact representation of the flow. Additional information can be found in the <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/introduction/grants/#identity-providers">Open Payments</LinkOut> documentation.
