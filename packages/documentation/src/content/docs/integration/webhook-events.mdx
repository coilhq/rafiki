title: Webhook Events
---

import { Mermaid } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

Paired together with the [`backend` Admin API](/apis/backend/mutations), webhook events are the main communication channel between the Rafiki instance and the Account Servicing Entity.
Most events require the Account Servicing Entity's server to interact with Rafiki, either to deposit or withdraw liquidity into or from Rafiki, or to provide wallet address information. This document will describe how an Account Servicing Entity should handle each of the defined webhook events.

## Setup

When events happen in the Rafiki instance, the Rafiki `backend` service will make a POST request to the configured `WEBHOOK_URL` (`backend` environment variable), and will expect a 200 status in the response.

### Request Body

Each webhook has the following structure in the request body:

| Variable Name | Type                          | Description |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| `id`          | String                        | Unique UUID |
| `type`        | Enum: [EventType](#eventtype) |             |
| `data`        | Object                        | Event data  |

#### EventType

| Value                                                                | Description                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`incoming_payment.created`](#incoming_paymentcreated)               | An incoming payment has been created.                                              |
| [`incoming_payment.completed`](#incoming_paymentcompleted)           | An incoming payment is complete and will not accept any additional incoming funds. |
| [`incoming_payment.expired`](#incoming_paymentexpired)               | An incoming payment expired and will not accept any additional incoming funds.     |
| [`outgoing_payment.created`](#outgoing_paymentcreated)               | An outgoing payment was created.                                                   |
| [`outgoing_payment.completed`](#outgoing_paymentcompleted)           | An outgoing payment completed.                                                     |
| [`outgoing_payment.failed`](#outgoing_paymentfailed)                 | An outgoing payment partially or completely failed.                                |
| [`wallet_address.not_found`](#wallet_addressnot_found)               | A requested wallet address was not found.                                          |
| [`wallet_address.web_monetization`](#wallet_addressweb_monetization) | Web Monetization payments received via STREAM.                                     |
| [`asset.liquidity_low`](#assetliquidity_low)                         | Asset liquidity has dropped below defined threshold.                               |
| [`peer.liquidity_low`](#peerliquidity_low)                           | Peer liquidity has dropped below defined threshold.                                |

An OpenAPI specification of the webhook requests and their corresponding data can be found [here](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/packages/backend/src/openapi/specs/webhooks.yaml).

Additionally, the [local playground](/playground/overview#usage) contains example payloads in the Bruno collection that can be used to test a webhook service integration.

## Events

### `incoming_payment.created`

The `incoming_payment.created` event indicates that an incoming payment has been created. This webhook event is only informational, since at this point, the incoming payment has not received any funds (i.e. no actions around liquidity are required). This webhook event could be used by the Account Servicing Entity to display upcoming incoming payments to their users.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: incoming payment created
    ASE->>ASE: no action required

`}
/>

### `incoming_payment.completed`

The `incoming_payment.completed` event indicates that an incoming payment has been completed, either automatically or manually, and that any funds that have been received into this incoming payment should be withdrawn and credited to the recipient's account with the Account Servicing Entity.

In addition, the `CreateIncomingPaymentWithdrawal` mutation supports [two-phase transfers](/reference/glossary#two-phase-transfers).

Example: An incoming payment was completed and received **$10**.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: incoming payment completed,<br>receivedAmount: $10
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateIncomingPaymentWithdrawal
    ASE->>ASE: credit receiver's account with $10

`}
/>

Example: An incoming payment supporting two-phase transfers was completed and recieved **$10**.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

      R->>ASE: webhook event: incoming payment completed,<br>receivedAmount: $10
      ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateIncomingPaymentWithdrawal
      ASE->>ASE: credit receiver's account with $10
      ASE->>R: admin API call: PostLiquidityWithdrawal
      R->>R: 2-phase transfer completed

`}
/>

### `incoming_payment.expired`

The `incoming_payment.expired` event indicates that an incoming payment has expired, and that any funds that have been received into this incoming payment should be withdrawn and credited to the recipient's account with the Account Servicing Entity. Note that this event is not fired if there were no funds received by the incoming payment since there is no action required by the Account Servicing Entity.

Example: An incoming payment has expired and received **$2.55**.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: incoming payment expired,<br>receivedAmount: $2.55
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateIncomingPaymentWithdrawal
    ASE->>ASE: credit receiver's account with $2.55

`}
/>

### `outgoing_payment.created`

The `outgoing_payment.created` event indicates that an outgoing payment has been created and is awaiting liquidity. The Account Servicing Entity should verify the user account balance (and perform any other kinds of checks necessary) before funding or cancelling the outgoing payment.
In the case where the outgoing payment should _not_ be fullfilled, the Account Servicing Entity can cancel the outgoing payment.
Otherwise, the Account Servicing Entity should put a hold on the senderâ€™s account and deposit the funds into Rafiki.

Example: An outgoing payment for **&dollar;12** has been created.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki
    R->>ASE: webhook event: outgoing payment created,<br>debitAmount: $12
    ASE->>ASE: check if account has enough balance
    alt Account has enough balance
    ASE->>ASE: put hold of $12 on sender's account
    ASE->>R: admin API call: DepositOutgoingPaymentLiquidity
    end
    alt Account does not have enough balance
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CancelOutgoingPayment<br>reason: Not enough balance
    end

`}
/>

### `outgoing_payment.completed`

The `outgoing_payment.completed` event indicates that an outgoing payment has successfully sent as many funds as possible to the receiver. The Account Servicing Entity should withdraw any excess liquidity from that outgoing payment in Rafiki and use it as they see fit. One option would be to return it to the sender. Another option is that the excess liquidity is considered a fee and retained by the Account Servicing Entity. Furthermore, the Account Servicing Entity should remove the hold on the sender's account and debit it.

In addition, the `CreateOutgoingPaymentWithdrawal` mutation supports [two-phase transfers](/reference/glossary#two-phase-transfers).

Example: An outgoing payment amount for **&dollar;12** has been completed. **&dollar;11.50** were sent. The Account Servicing Entity keeps **$0.50** as fees.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: outgoing completed,<br>debitAmount: $12, sentAmount:$11.50
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateOutgoingPaymentWithdrawal
    ASE->>ASE: remove the hold and deduct $12 from the sender's account,<br>credit ASE's account with $0.50

`}
/>

Example: An outgoing payment supporting two-phase transfers for **&dollar;12** has been completed. **&dollar;11.50** were sent. The Account Servicing Entity keeps **$0.50** as fees.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

        R->>ASE: webhook event: outgoing completed,<br>debitAmount: $12, sentAmount:$11.50
        ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateOutgoingPaymentWithdrawal
        ASE->>ASE: remove the hold and deduct $12 from the sender's account,<br>credit ASE's account with $0.50
        ASE->>R: admin API call: PostLiquidityWithdrawal
        R->>R: 2-phase transfer completed

`}
/>

### `outgoing_payment.failed`

The `outgoing_payment.failed` event indicates that an outgoing payment has either partially or completely failed and a retry was also unsuccessful. The Account Servicing Entity should withdraw any remaining liquidity from that outgoing payment in Rafiki. If the payment failed completely (the `sentAmount` was 0), the Account Servicing Entity should remove the hold from the sender's account. If the payment failed partially, the Account Servicing Entity should remove the hold from the sender's account and debit it with the amount that has been sent, but they should refrain from taking a sending fee.

Example: An outgoing payment for **&dollar;12** has failed. **$8** were sent.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: outgoing failed,<br>debitAmount: $12, sentAmount:$8
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateOutgoingPaymentWithdrawal
    ASE->>ASE: remove the hold and deduct $8 from the sender's account

`}
/>

### `wallet_address.web_monetization`

The `wallet_address.web_monetization` event indicates that a wallet address has received web monetization payments via STREAM (raw ILP access). The Account Servicing Entity should withdraw that liquidity from the wallet address and credit the receiver's account.

Example: A wallet address received **$0.33**

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: wallet address web monetization,<br>receivedAmount: $0.33
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateWalletAddressWithdrawal
    ASE->>ASE: credit receiver's account with $0.33

`}
/>

### `wallet_address.not_found`

The `wallet_address.not_found` event indicates that a [wallet address](/reference/glossary#wallet-address) was requested (via the [Open Payments API](/reference/glossary#open-payments)), but it doesn't exist in Rafiki. When receiving this event, the Account Servicing Entity can perform a lookup for the relevant account in their system, and [create](/integration/getting-started#issuing-wallet-addresses) a wallet address. The initial request for the wallet address will succeed if the Account Servicing Entity creates it within the configurable [`WALLET_ADDRESS_LOOKUP_TIMEOUT_MS`](/integration/deployment#environment-variables) timeframe.

Example: The wallet address `https://example-wallet.com/carla_garcia` was requested but does not yet exist

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: wallet address not found,<br>wallet address: https://example-wallet.com/carla_garcia
    ASE->>R: admin API call: CreateWalletAddress<br>url: https://example-wallet.com/carla_garcia,<br>public name: Carla Eva Garcia

`}
/>

### `asset.liquidity_low`

The `asset.liquidity_low` event indicates that the liquidity of an [asset](/reference/glossary#asset) has dropped below a predefined liquidity threshold. When receiving this event, the Account Servicing Entity should check if they have or can acquire additional liquidity of said asset and if so, deposit it in Rafiki. If the Account Servicing Entity cannot or does not increase the asset liquidity in Rafiki, cross-currency transfers will fail.

Example: The asset liquidity for USD (scale: 2) drops below 100.00 USD.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: liquidity (asset) low,<br>asset: USD (scale: 2, id: "abc")
    ASE->>R: admin API call: DepositAssetLiquidity

`}
/>

### `peer.liquidity_low`

The `peer.liquidity_low` event indicates that the liquidity of a [peer](/reference/glossary#peer) has dropped below a predefined liquidity threshold. When receiving this event, the Account Servicing Entity need to decide if they can extend said peer's credit line or whether they need to settle first and then extend a new line of credit. If the Account Servicing Entity cannot or does not increase the peer liquidity in Rafiki, transfers to that peer will fail.

Example: The peer liquidity for Happy Life Bank drops below 100.00 USD.

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant ASE as Account Servicing Entity
    participant R as Rafiki

    R->>ASE: webhook event: liquidity (peer) low,<br>peer: Happy Life Bank (asset: "USD", scale: 2, id: "abc")
    ASE->>R: admin API call: DepositPeerLiquidity

`}
/>

## Errors

If an error occurs when Rafiki sends a webhook event (a non-200 status is returned or the request times out), Rafiki will keep retrying the webhook requests at increasing intervals (first retry after 10 seconds, second after 20 more, next after 30 more, etc.) until a 200 status is returned. The maximum number of retries for webhook events can be configured via the `WEBHOOK_MAX_RETRY` environment variable.

Additionally, the timeout for webhook requests can be configured with the `WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT` environment variable.

## Best Practices

### Duplicate Events

The `id` in the webhook event payload is a unique UUID which can be used by the Account Servicing Entity's system to determine whether the event has been received previously, preventing duplicate processing of events.

### Asynchronous Handling

Account Servicing Entities should consider using a worker to process received webhook events, especially if requests to credit/debit user accounts are long processes. This would allow the server to process events at a rate suitable for the system, and would reduce the amount of failed/retried webhook events, since the webhook event listener can immediately reply with a successful 200 status.
