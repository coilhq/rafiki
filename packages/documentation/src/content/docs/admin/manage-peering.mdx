title: Manage peering relationships
---

import { CodeBlock, LinkOut } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

To join the Interledger network and be able to send and receive payments, you must add one or more peer(s) to your Rafiki instance.

## Prerequisites

Before you add a peer, you and the account servicing entity (ASE) you intend to peer with must both:

- Run an implementation of an [Interledger connector](/integration/services/backend-service#interledger-connector) (ideally Rafiki).
- Agree on an [asset](/overview/concepts/accounting#assets) for the peering relationship. You can set up multiple peering relationships with the same peer based on different assets. At least one asset shared by you and your peer must be added to your Rafiki instance prior to setting up the peering relationship.
- Agree on a `maxPacketAmount` value, which specifies how many packets a payment is split into.
- Communicate your respective static <LinkOut href="https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/ilp-addresses/">Interledger (ILP) addresses</LinkOut>.
- Communicate a connection endpoint for the other peer to send packets to.
- Exchange `auth` tokens for the connection endpoint.
- Agree on a settlement mechanism (a means of paying one another for the successful forwarding and delivery of packets), which is outside the scope of Interledger and Rafiki.

Optionally, you may also deposit an initial liquidity for your peer.

## Add peer using the `CreatePeer` GraphQL mutation

<CodeBlock title="Example CreatePeer Mutation">

```graphql
mutation CreatePeer($input: CreatePeerInput!) {
  createPeer(input: $input) {
    code
    success
    message
    peer {
      id
      asset {
        code
        scale
      }
      staticIlpAddress
      name
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlock>

### Example

<CodeBlock title='Example JSON request'>

```json
{
  "input": {
	"staticIlpAddress": "g.othergreatwallet",
	"name": "The Other Great Wallet"
	"http": {
  		"incoming": {"authTokens": ["mytoken"]},
  		"outgoing": {"endpoint": "ilp.othergreatwallet.com", "authToken": "theirtoken"}
	  },
	"assetId": "INSERT_ASSET_ID",
	"initialLiquidity": <optionally, an intial amount of liquity to provision. Liquidity can also be deposited via the `DepositPeerLiquidity`>
  }
}

## Add a peer using Rafiki Admin

Alternatively, a peer can be added through the [Rafiki Admin](/admin/admin-user-guide#create-peer) application. Ideally, this will be done using your [local Rafiki environment](/integration/playground/overview/#running-the-local-environment).

Refer to the [Rafiki Admin application user guide](/admin/admin-user-guide/#peers) for more information on adding peers.
