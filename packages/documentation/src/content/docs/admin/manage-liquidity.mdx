title: Manage liquidity
---

import { CodeBlock, LinkOut } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

As an implementation of the Interledger Protocol, Rafiki provides [accounting](/overview/concepts/accounting) between transacting parties but doesn’t handle settlement. You and the account servicing entities you decide to peer with must agree on the means and how often you will settle your accounts. Consequently, Rafiki can manage the liquidity used to fund payments made through the Interledger network.

As Rafiki supports several types of liquidity, we’ll cover the typical scenarios you’ll need to manage.

:::note
You must provide the `idempotencyKey` when calling mutations related to liquidity. This key allows the safe retrying of requests without multiple operations. It should be a unique key, typically a V4 UUID. For more information, refer to Rafiki’s idempotency.
:::

## Asset Liquidity

Asset liquidity specifies the amount of value denominated in an asset you have previously added to your Rafiki instance, which Rafiki has at its disposal to send or forward Interledger packets. Asset liquidity increases if packets denominated in the asset are received and decreases if your Rafiki instance sends packets denominated in the asset. The amount is always non-negative.

You should define and adjust the asset liquidity based on your risk tolerance.

### Deposit asset liquidity using the `DepositAssetLiquidity` mutation

<CodeBlock title="DepositAssetLiquidity mutation">

```graphql
mutation DepositAssetLiquidity($input: DepositAssetLiquidityInput!) {
  depositAssetLiquidity(input: $input) {
    code
    success

### Deposit and withdraw asset liquidity using Rafiki Admin

Asset liquidity can also be added through the [Rafiki Admin](/admin/admin-user-guide/#edit-asset) application. Navigate to the liquidity information section on the main Assets page and then select deposit or withdraw liquidity.

## Peer Liquidity

Peer liquidity is the line of credit denominated in the asset of the peering relationship in Rafiki that you extend to your respective peer. You must determine how much credit you will extend in your peering agreement, which depends on how much you trust the peer. If peer liquidity is insufficient, Rafiki cannot initiate payments to that peer. Once peer liquidity is used up, you should settle with your peer and reset their peer liquidity.

:::note  
You must decide whether to secure liquidity with your peers by extending credit or requiring them to pre-fund your accounts. Those agreements must be made before setting up peering relationships in Rafiki and are not managed through Interledger or Rafiki.

### Deposit and withdraw peer liquidity using Rafiki Admin

Peer liquidity can also be added through the [Rafiki Admin](/admin/admin-user-guide/#edit-peer) application. Navigate to the liquidity information section on the main Peers page and then select deposit or withdraw liquidity.

## Payment Liquidity

When Open Payments incoming or outgoing payments are created, your Rafiki instance creates a liquidity account within the accounting database. Liquidity must be deposited into an outgoing payment before the payment can be processed. Rafiki will notify you to deposit liquidity via the `outgoing_payment.created` webhook event. Similarly, packets received for an incoming payment increase its liquidity account. Rafiki will notify you to withdraw that liquidity via the `incoming_payment.completed` webhook event.

### Withdraw incoming payment liquidity using the `CreateIncomingPaymentWithdrawal` mutation

## Two-phase withdrawals

Rafiki supports <LinkOut href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol'>two-phase</LinkOut> withdrawals via the `PostLiquidityWithdrawal` and `VoidLiquidityWithdrawal` mutations. When a withdrawal liquidity transaction is requested with a non-zero `timeout` value (zero denotes absence of a timeout), the transfer will be created as a two-phase transfer. If the timeout interval passes before the transfer is either posted or voided, the transfer expires and the full amount is returned to the original account.

- `PostLiquidityWithdrawal`: Withdrawals with timeouts greater than 0 are processed as two-phase transfers and committed via this mutation.

- `VoidLiquidityWithdrawal`: Withdrawals with timeouts greater than 0 are processed as two-phase transfers and are rolled back via this mutation.

The following withdrawal transactions supports two-phase transfers:

- Asset liquidity withdrawal
- Wallet address withdrawal
- Peer liquidity withdrawal
- Incoming payment withdrawal
- Outgoing payment withdrawal

### Post and commit a sucessful transfer using the `PostLiquidityWithdrawal` mutation
