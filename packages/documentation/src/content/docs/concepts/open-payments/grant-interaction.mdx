## Endpoints

If the AS deems interaction necessary to issue a grant, there are five main endpoints that are used once a pending grant has been created. The endpoints, in order of their calling, are as follows:

- `GET /interact/:id/:nonce` (made by the client to the AS, establishes an interaction session, redirects browser session to IDP consent screen)
- `GET /grant/:id/:nonce` (made by the IDP to the AS, secured with `x-idp-secret` header, returns grant info for the consent screen to enumerate )
- `POST /grant/:id/:nonce/(accept OR reject)` (made by the IDP to the AS, secured with `x-idp-secret` header, accepts or rejects the grant based on the user's input on the consent screen. **IDP then redirects to `GET /interact/:id/:nonce/finish`**)
- `GET /interact/:id/:nonce/finish` (ends the interaction established by `GET /interact/:id/:nonce`, redirects browser session to client callback. Contains a query param that either indicates a failure, or on success, a `hash` parameter that the client can use to verify the successful interaction, and the `interact_ref` that identifies the interaction on the AS.)
  - Examples include: - `?result=grant_rejected` (if interaction was rejected) - `?result=grant_invalid` (if grant is not in a state where it may be accepted or rejected, e.g. already approved) - `?hash=p28jsq0Y2KK3WS__a42tavNC64ldGTBroywsWxT4md_jZQ1R\HZT8BOWYHcLmObM7XHPAdJzTZMtKBsaraJ64A
&interact_ref=4IFWWIKYBC2PQ6U56NL1` (if interaction was accepted) - `hash` is a `sha-256` hash of values provided by the client in the body of the [grant initialization request](https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/post-request) (`interact.finish.nonce`), values returned in the AS response for that request (`interact.finish`), the `interact_ref` provided alongside the `hash`, and the uri of the grant initialization request (`https://auth-server.com/`).
- `POST /continue/:id` ([this should still be accurate](https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference/post-continue), final back-channel request made by client if interaction was successful, AS responds with an access token)

### On `x-idp-secret`

`x-idp-secret` is the name of a header that is used for `GET /grant/:id/:nonce`, `POST /grant/:id/:nonce/accept`, and `POST /grant/:id/:nonce/reject` requests. Its purpose is to secure communications between the IDP and the AS and its value should be a shared secret known to both entities.

To set this up, set the `IDENTITY_SERVER_SECRET` on the AS environment to a value that is also used to configure the IDP's requests to the AS.
