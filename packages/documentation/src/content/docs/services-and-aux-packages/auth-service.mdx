## Auth

The `auth` service performs authorization and authentication of incoming requests. For requests from entities that have accounts within the local instance of Rafiki, the `auth` service uses data stored in the auth postgres database. For requests from clients registered with other instances of Rafiki, the auth service resolves the client's public key from its source and uses it to authenticate and authorize the request. Additionally, it also exposes an GraphQL Admin API to manage auth related resources (such as grants).
