# Frontend

The `frontend` project is a web app through which Rafiki administrators can manage their Rafiki instance though a UI. `frontend` communicates with the `backend` Admin API to manage [wallet addresses](/reference/glossary#wallet-address), [peering relationships](/reference/glossary#peer), and [assets](/reference/glossary#asset), among other settings.
