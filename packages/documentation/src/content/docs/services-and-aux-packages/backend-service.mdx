## Backend

The `backend` service has four responsibilities:

- Expose REST [Open Payments API](https://docs.openpayments.guide/reference) endpoints for public clients to perform account management tasks.
- Expose an internal GraphQL Admin API for service operators to manage accounts and application settings like peering relationships.
- Expose an [ILP connector](/concepts/interledger-protocol/connector) to send and receive STREAM packets with peers.
- Business logic to manage accounts and track balances.

The `backend`'s ILP functionality includes:

- Accepting ILP packets over an HTTP interface and authenticating them against ILP account credentials
- Routing ILP packets to the correct destination account
- Converting currencies
- Sending out ILP packets over HTTP for destinations that are not local
- Fulfilling packets with an internal STREAM server
