Rafiki is a collection of three services that are run together; each one can be scaled horizontally. These services are

- [`backend`](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/packages/backend): The main service, handling business logic and external communication.
- [`auth`](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/packages/auth): The service used for Grant Authorization and authentication. Rafiki provides this as a reference implementation, with the understanding that Rafiki operators can use and deploy their own service for authorization and authentication.
- [`frontend`](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/packages/frontend): An internal admin interface for Rafiki operators to manage their Rafiki instance.

These services rely on four databases:

- A postgres database used by the `backend`
- A separate postgres database used by `auth`.
- [TigerBeetle](https://github.com/coilhq/tigerbeetle) used by `backend` for accounting balances at the ILP layer.
- Redis used by `backend` as a cache to share STREAM connection details across processes and `auth` to store session data.
