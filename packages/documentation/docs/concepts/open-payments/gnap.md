# Grant Negotiation Authorization Protocol (GNAP)

The Grant Negotiation Authorization Protocol (GNAP) defines a mechanism for delegating authorization to a piece of software, and conveying the results and artifacts of that delegation to the software. This delegation can include access to a set of APIs as well as subject information passed directly to the software. For more information, see the [specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-12).
