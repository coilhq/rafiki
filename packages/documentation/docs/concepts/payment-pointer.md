# Payment Pointer

A Payment Pointer is a standardized identifier for a payment account. In the same way that an email address provides an identifier for a mailbox in the email ecosystem, a payment pointer is used by an account holder to share the details of their account with a counter-party. For more details, see the [documentation](https://paymentpointers.org/).
